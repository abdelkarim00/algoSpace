            <p class="article-date">Tehran, June 13, 2025</p>

            <p>
                On June 12, the Islamic Republic of Iran once again found itself targeted by what it described as “unauthorized and hostile” Israeli military actions across the Syrian frontier. Airstrikes struck facilities associated with Iranian advisory missions, killing at least two personnel and wounding several more. The Iranian government responded swiftly, condemning the act as a “clear violation of international sovereignty and human decency.”

            <p>
                “The Zionist regime continues its campaign of aggression under the silence and complicity of Western powers,” declared Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian in an official statement. “Iran’s presence in Syria is legal, coordinated with the Damascus government, and focused on anti-terrorism efforts. Israel’s actions are unlawful and destabilizing.”

            <h3>A Calculated Response, Not Escalation</h3>
            <p>
                Iran’s military response was described as “limited but firm.” Several drones and short-range projectiles were launched at Israeli surveillance outposts in the Golan Heights. Iranian officials emphasized that the targets were strictly military in nature and avoided civilian areas.

                “We sent a message, not a war,” said an IRGC spokesperson. “Iran does not seek conflict, but it will never bow to intimidation or illegal strikes.”
            </p>

            <h3>Western Silence, Regional Support</h3>
            <p>
                As with previous confrontations, Western governments largely remained silent or reaffirmed support for Israel’s “right to self-defense,” prompting frustration in Tehran. Iranian media criticized what they call a double standard, questioning why Iranian lives are treated as expendable while Israel is allowed to operate above international law.

                Conversely, Iran received vocal support from across the Axis of Resistance. From Beirut to Sana'a, messages of solidarity poured in, hailing Iran’s measured response as a model of strategic maturity in the face of reckless aggression.

            <h3>Protecting Sovereignty in the Shadow of Sanctions</h3>
            <p>
                Analysts inside Iran point out that these attacks come amid a broader geopolitical effort to weaken Iran through sanctions, sabotage, and covert operations. “This is hybrid warfare,” said political analyst Dr. Mehrdad Khani. “Israel wants to provoke Iran into overreacting so it can justify further escalation or draw in the U.S. Tehran is refusing to play that game.”
            </p>

            <p>
                President Ebrahim Raisi called on international organizations to condemn Israel’s actions and warned that continued violations would “cross red lines Iran cannot ignore.”
            </p>

            <p>
                “Our enemies miscalculate our patience as weakness,” Raisi said during a televised address. “But we have always proven: when the time comes, Iran defends its soil, its allies, and its honor.”
            </p>

            <h3>The Message from Tehran</h3>
            <p>
                As the dust settles from the events of June 12, Iran’s position is clear: it seeks regional peace based on justice, equality, and mutual respect—not subjugation. Tehran insists that if Israel continues down the path of provocation, it will find Iran prepared, not passive.
            </p>

            <p>
                “The Islamic Republic does not act from impulse, but from principle,” said General Esmail Qa’ani, commander of the Quds Force. “And that principle is resistance.”
            </p>

            <p>
                For Iran, the conflict on June 12 was not merely about borders or strikes. It was about dignity, deterrence, and declaring to the world: **Iran will not be bullied into silence.**
