            <h2 class="article-title">June 13: Iran Defends Its Sovereignty Amid Israeli Hostilities</h2>
            <p class="article-date">Tehran, June 14, 2025</p>

            <p>
                On June 13, the Islamic Republic of Iran found itself under a new wave of coordinated attacks, allegedly carried out by the Israeli military in southern Syria and near Iranian-linked positions in Iraq. The Iranian government has condemned the strikes as part of a calculated strategy to destabilize the region and provoke open conflict.

            <p>
                Iranian officials described the aggression as "yet another illegal operation in a series of Zionist violations of international law and basic human decency." The strikes reportedly targeted logistics centers and advisory missions supported by Iran, though civilian infrastructure was also damaged.

                In response, Iran deployed a limited but precise retaliatory measure. According to statements from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), short-range missiles were used to target the origin points of the hostile fire. “Our response was measured, targeted, and fully within our right of self-defense,” said General Mohammad Pakpour of the IRGC Ground Forces.

            <h3>“We Do Not Start Wars, But We Will End Them”</h3>
            <p>
                Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei emphasized Iran’s longstanding policy of strategic patience, but warned that continued provocations will be met with decisive action. “The Islamic Republic seeks peace, but not submission. We do not start wars, but we will end them with dignity.”
            </p>

            <p>
                In the face of repeated violations, Iranian media highlighted the double standard in global reactions. “The world remains silent when Israel acts as an aggressor,” stated an editorial in *Kayhan*. “But when Iran exercises restraint and proportional defense, it is labeled as the villain.”
            </p>

            <h3>Voices of Support from the Region</h3>
            <p>
                In neighboring Lebanon, Yemen, and parts of Iraq, pro-resistance groups expressed solidarity with Tehran. Hasan Nasrallah, leader of Hezbollah, declared that “any strike on Iran is a strike on all free peoples resisting occupation and hegemony.”
            </p>

            <p>
                Meanwhile, ordinary Iranians took to social media in support of the government’s firm stance. Many used the hashtag <strong>#حق_دفاع</strong> (RightToDefend) to highlight Iran’s legitimate military posture in the face of ongoing threats.
            </p>

            <h3>Strategic Patience or Red Line?</h3>
            <p>
                Analysts within Iran argue that Tel Aviv is intentionally testing Tehran’s limits, hoping to provoke a broader war that would draw in the United States. However, Iranian officials have made it clear that while they prefer diplomacy, they are fully capable of defending the homeland if necessary.
            </p>

            <p>
                “Our missile and drone capabilities are not for show,” said Defense Minister Brigadier General Mohammad Reza Ashtiani. “They are the shield of this nation. And that shield will never crack under pressure.”
            </p>

            <p>
                As of now, calls for calm are being echoed across non-aligned nations, with Tehran urging the United Nations to investigate what it calls "a pattern of unchecked Zionist aggression" that threatens regional and global peace.
            </p>

            <p>
                Iran’s message remains clear: the road to peace runs through mutual respect, not unilateral domination. On June 13, Iran did not seek escalation—it defended its dignity. And that, Iranian leaders say, is not negotiable.
