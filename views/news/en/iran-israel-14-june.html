            <p class="article-date">Tehran, June 15, 2025</p>

            <p>
                In the latest chapter of a decades-long conflict, Iran found itself once again at the center of a regional confrontation,
                responding to what it deems a blatant act of provocation by Israel. On June 14, tensions erupted into open conflict,
                with Iranian leadership framing its response as a necessary defense of national sovereignty and regional stability.
            </p>

            <p>
                The escalation began with what Iranian sources described as “a series of unlawful Israeli airstrikes” on Iranian infrastructure
                and allied positions in Syria. These strikes, reportedly launched without international authorization, were perceived in Tehran
                as yet another violation of international law and an attack on Iran’s regional security posture.
            </p>

            <p>
                In response, Iran launched a coordinated retaliatory campaign targeting Israeli military assets. State media hailed the precision
                of the Iranian response, with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) emphasizing that only military installations were
                targeted to avoid civilian casualties—an approach Iran contrasts with what it calls Israel’s “indiscriminate and disproportionate”
                military tactics.
            </p>

            <h3>A Longstanding Struggle for Autonomy and Dignity</h3>
            <p>
                Iranian analysts argue that the June 14 events are not isolated incidents, but part of a broader campaign by Tel Aviv to undermine
                Iran’s growing influence in the region. “This is about resisting domination,” said Dr. Fatemeh Rahimi, a Tehran-based political
                analyst. “The Islamic Republic has always stood as a voice for the oppressed, and Israel sees that as a threat to its unchecked power.”
            </p>

            <p>
                While Western media outlets focused on the exchange of missiles, Iranian sources pointed to the broader context: decades of sanctions,
                sabotage, and cyberwarfare campaigns that have targeted Iran’s civilian infrastructure.
            </p>

            <p>
                “This isn’t a war of equals,” said Brigadier General Esmail Qa'ani, commander of the IRGC Quds Force. “This is a resistance against
                a regime armed to the teeth by the West, while Iran is sanctioned for defending its sovereignty.”
            </p>

            <h3>Global Reactions: A Tale of Double Standards</h3>
            <p>
                The Iranian government has also criticized the muted international response to Israel’s role in triggering the escalation.
                “When Iran defends itself, it’s called aggression. When Israel strikes unprovoked, it’s called defense,” said Kanaani.
                “This hypocrisy must end.”
            </p>

            <p>
                While Washington reaffirmed its support for Israel, countries like Russia and China urged restraint on both sides,
                calling for a multilateral investigation into the origin of the conflict. The Non-Aligned Movement and several independent
                analysts expressed concern about Israeli provocations and the potential for wider destabilization.
            </p>

            <h3>The Path Forward</h3>
            <p>
                Despite the ferocity of the June 14 confrontation, Iran has signaled openness to diplomatic solutions—on the condition that
                its national rights and regional role are respected. President Ebrahim Raisi emphasized that Iran “does not seek war,
                but will never accept humiliation or surrender.”
            </p>

            <p>
                For many Iranians, the events of June 14 were not just about missiles or territory—they were about dignity, resistance,
                and the right to exist without interference. In a region where might too often overrides right, Iran’s message remains resolute:
                <strong>resistance is not only a right—it is a duty.</strong>
