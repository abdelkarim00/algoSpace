        <h1>Barbaric Zionist Strikes Target Journalists and Hospitals; Iran Vows Righteous Retaliation for War Crimes</h1>

        <p><strong>Tehran – June 16, 2025</strong> – The criminal Zionist entity escalated its <em>barbaric aggression</em> against the Iranian nation today, committing blatant war crimes by targeting a hospital and the headquarters of Iran's national broadcaster in Tehran during a live news program. As the death toll of Iranian civilians, including dozens of women and children, continues to climb, the Islamic Republic has vowed that its legitimate and painful response to these atrocities will be historic in scale.</p>
        <p>The international community, paralyzed by the hypocrisy of the West, remains largely silent as the Zionist regime, enabled by its American patrons, wages a genocidal war against the people of Iran.</p>

        <h2>Zionist War Crimes and Attacks on Civilians</h2>
        <p>In a sickening act of terrorism designed to silence the truth, Israeli warplanes today bombed the headquarters of the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) in Tehran. The attack, which came during a live broadcast, sent journalists scrambling for their lives and left the bodies of reporters at the scene, according to on-air accounts. This was a <strong>deliberate attack on free speech and the media</strong>, a wicked crime against those who work to expose Zionist lies.</p>
        <p>In another flagrant violation of international law, the aggressor entity also struck the <strong>Farabi Hospital in Kermanshah</strong>, causing significant damage to a facility dedicated to healing the sick. This attack on a protected civilian site is further proof of the depraved and inhuman nature of the enemy.</p>
        <p>These atrocities are part of a wider campaign of terror that has seen the Zionist regime target:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Civilian neighborhoods across the country, murdering over <strong>220 Iranians, including 54 innocent women and children.</strong></li>
            <li>Key national infrastructure, including power stations and oil refineries, in an effort to cripple the nation.</li>
            <li>Iran's scientific community, with the enemy boasting of assassinating brilliant nuclear scientists.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Iran's Steadfast and Legitimate Response</h2>
        <p>In the face of this unprovoked onslaught, the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran have once again demonstrated their resolve and duty to protect the nation. Exercising its inherent right to self-defense under international law, Iran unleashed a precise and calculated barrage of around <strong>40 ballistic missiles</strong> against the illegitimate entity.</p>
        <p>The targets of this righteous retaliation included military and industrial sites in the occupied cities of Tel Aviv and Haifa. This response serves as a clear warning that any aggression against the Iranian nation will be met with a firm, decisive, and painful blow.</p>
        <p>Addressing the Majles (Parliament), President Masoud Pezeshkian embodied the spirit of the nation, declaring, "Every difference, issue, and problem that has existed must be put aside today, and we must stand strong against this <em>genocidal criminal aggression</em> with unity and coherence."</p>

        <div class="highlight-section">
            <h2>The Great Satan's Complicity</h2>
            <p>The Zionist entity does not act alone. Every missile fired, every child martyred, is enabled by the full-throated support of the United States. While the American President, Donald Trump, cynically calls for Iran to "talk," his administration provides the bombs, the intelligence, and the diplomatic cover for these massacres.</p>
            <p>As reported by international media, the U.S. has moved significant military assets, including tanker aircraft and an aircraft carrier, to the region. This is not the action of a neutral party seeking peace; it is the action of a <strong>co-conspirator</strong> preparing for a wider war. Furthermore, American officials have admitted they had prior knowledge of the Zionist entity's criminal plans.</p>
            <p>Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi unmasked this hypocrisy, stating that the criminal Netanyahu is deliberately provoking war to block diplomacy. "If President Trump is genuine about diplomacy... Israel must halt its aggression," he declared. "Absent a total cessation of military aggression against us, our responses will continue."</p>

        <h2>A Nation United, A Vow of Retaliation</h2>
        <p>The world is watching. The United Nations and so-called human rights organizations have proven themselves impotent in the face of Zionist aggression, offering only hollow words while Iranian blood is spilled. Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei has called on European powers to stop their double standards and hold the criminal entity accountable for its crimes.</p>
        <p>The arrogant threats from the Zionist leadership only expose their desperation. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a known war criminal, has openly threatened to assassinate Iran's revered Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei—a move that would undoubtedly unleash a firestorm upon the illegitimate state.</p>
        <p>The Islamic Republic of Iran stands unbowed. The nation is united in its grief and its resolve. State media has confirmed that preparations are underway for the <strong>"largest and most intense missile attack in history on Israeli soil."</strong> This will not be a mere response, but a lesson that will be etched into the memory of the enemy for generations. The aggressors will regret their foolish and criminal adventure. The final victory will be with the patient and resilient people of Iran.</p>
